            Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
            published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
            media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
            Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
            and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also
            referred as the &quot;core series&quot; by their developers

              <p>
                Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire
                and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This
                creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
                new players. Water is the most common type with over 100
                Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other
                sea-dwelling creatures.

                Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water
                and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This
                creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
                new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages
                of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a
                plus.

                creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to
                new players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically,
                with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to
                Grass moves.

                that discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and
                visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in
                spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for
                reporting that he&#39;d lost 65 pounds between July and
                December.

                grossed almost $2 billion in revenue and been downloaded 800
                million times. Although no longer the global phenomenon it was
                in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.

              that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu,
              everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance

              flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes
              fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never

                We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you
                know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for
                every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the
                rodent&#39;s evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has
                an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast
                amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this
                species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon
                trainers should be able to answer.

                Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model
                you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are
                needed if you&#39;re looking to keep up with some of the
                stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve

                point where you&#39;re presented with the most effective Poke
                Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button

                have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games -
